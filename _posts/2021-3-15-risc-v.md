## CALCULATE

### ADD

- e.g. `ADD x1 x0 x0` means  `x1 = x0 + x0` 



### ADDI

 -  e.g. `ADDI x1 x0 0x11` means `x1 = x0 + 3 (DEC)`
 -  The difference is that ADDI is used for numerical, while ADD is used for registers (or variable we can say)
 -  Normally, we can discover `ADDI sp sp -32 ` at the beginning of the program.  It's used for allocate memory for the main program. `sp` is the pointer of a stack, use to record the runtime memory stack.



## MEMORY

### la

- `la` means **load address**
- e.g. `la x1 VAL`  VAL's address is at `0x100`, and it's value is `0x11` then `x1 = 0x100`
- equal to 

```assembly
lui t0, SYMBOL[31:12]
addi t0, t0, SYMBOL[11:0]
```

### lw

- `lw` means **load word**
- e.g. `lw x2 VAL` causes `x2 = 0x11`

### sw

- `sw` means **save word**
- e.g. `sw x3 0(x1)` will cause `x3 = 0x11` and `x3 = x2`

### li

- `li` means load immediate
- e.g. `li a0 VAL` means `a0 = VAL = 0x114514 `for example



the Point is that **L** means load, **S** means save. **a|b|h|w|d** means address, byte, half word, word or double word.



## Branch

### beq 

- `beq x1 x2 Label1` means `if(x1 == x2) goto Label1`



## Others



### AUIPC

- `AUIPC` means add an immediate number to pc 

- e.g. `auipc x28 65536` means
